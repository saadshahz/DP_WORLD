                  Conserving resources and developing the future of the country is the cornerstone of most CSR activities DP World undertakes within the subcontinent.DP World believes that channelizing its resources to ensure that people have the wherewithal in the long run, to make both ends meet would be more productive. Our approach to corporate responsibility is anchored in the ‘four quadrant’ model of Community, Environment, People & Safety and Marketplace. Within each quadrant we have a number of existing initiatives and we are continuously adding new initiatives.
               <br>
Pivotal to the success of this approach is the integration of corporate responsibility principles into the everyday business process, planning and strategy as we recognize that this will bring long term benefits to the community, the environment, our people, our customers and the business as a whole. This approach is built around our overall Vision as well as our Values.

                  DP World Karachi celebrated International Social day by joining hands with the people of our adopted village and the people of Sindh Welfare Association for the Deaf, an organization supported by QICT. The idea was to encourage women folk to enter entrepreneurship and to help support the financial system of their homes, besides gaining financial independence.A Social day bazaar was held on the 9th of March at a prominent hotel in Karachi sponsored by QICT. Stalls were set up by Sindh Welfare Association for the Deaf where they sold beautiful handicrafts made by the students of the Association. Another stall selling Bed Linen stitched by the Women of the Adopted Village was set up. The Ladies of QICT actively participated too; they teamed up and set up a stall with refreshments of sorts homemade by them. The proceeds of this stall will be used for educational purposes and to encourage educating the girl child in parts of Karachi where education is limited or scarce for need  people.
The visitors witnessed a fun and laughter-filled environment as children were occupied excitedly with numerous games, face painting & activities. Ladies enjoyed having henna applied to their hands. The overall experience was overwhelming and the bazaar concluded on a positive note.
